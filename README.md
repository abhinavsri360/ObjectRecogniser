## ObjectRecognizer
This is a flutter application that implements a custom deep-learning model that recognizes objects and tells about what they classify to be according to the model. The model was created by [@nirupamgarg](https://github.com/nirupamgarg) and the code to model can be found in his repository linked here: [Object-recognition](https://github.com/nirupamgarg/Object-recoginition)

Please find the application apk file here: [ObjectRecognizer](https://apkfab.com/customml/abhinav.customml/apk?h=5926c39c30790722ce52bcb3cc8cf4bccd3a19a647fa64d24a07b4e829754124)
